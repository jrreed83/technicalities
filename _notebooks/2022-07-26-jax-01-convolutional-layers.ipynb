    "## How Convolutional Layers work\n",
    "\n",
    "A two dimensional convolutional layer consists of several randomly initialized filters, biases, and a rule for moving the filters across a set of images.  Typically, the input array is rank 4, meaning that the shape has 4 components.  One of these components represents the number of individual images in the input,  two of them tell you the size of each of the images, and the fourth tells you the number of *input channels*.  The number of channels in an image is the number of components you need to completely describe a pixel.  For instance, a pixel in a gray-scale image is a number between 0 and 255 and therefore has one channel.  An RGB color image, on the otherhand, has 3 channels because it has a red component, green component, and blue component.\n",
    "\n",
    "When definining a layer, it's up to you to say how many output channels you want.  For each output channel, you'll generate one rank 3 filter and one scalar bias.  Convolving an input image with one of these output filters, and adding the bias term, results in a flat (i.e single channel) 2D array.  Performing this process for each of the filters and bias terms gives you a stack of arrays with thickness matching the number of output channels.  "
