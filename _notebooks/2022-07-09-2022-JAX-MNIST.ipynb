    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, I'm going to start implementing a JAX-based neural network library, and use it to synthesize a Fashion-MNIST classifier.  Features will be added over the coming weeks and months as I try tp tackle more advanced topics.  I don't intend to write a full-featured library/framework like Tensorflow or Pytorch.  Instead, my goal is compile a set of loosely coupled components that I can mix-and-match to solve problems that interest me.  When there's some educational benefit, funtionality will be written from scratch and validated against other well-known libraries (including JAX itself).  "
