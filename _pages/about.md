Hi, I'm Joey.  I work for a small, but very capable company that builds
situationally aware sensor systems using ideas from communications theory, 
signal processing, and machine learning.           

This website is an archive for things I've learned in transitioning from an
applied math guy to an electrically-oriented engineer.  Every effort will be taken to
make each article clear, concise, and useful.  An article written
today, should still make sense months or even years from now.  Jargon will be kept to a minimum,
and explained when necessary.
