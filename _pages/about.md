Hi, I'm Joey.  I work for a small, but very capable company that builds
situationally aware sensor systems using ideas from communications theory, 
signal processing, and machine learning.           

This website is an archive of technical stuff that I want to remember.  Every effort will be taken to
make each article clear, concise, and useful.
